#### (a)

This pseudo code is checking whether or not anything in the list is duplicated. 

#### (b)
This is the worst case because if there is no duplicates in the list given the algorithm will go through the whole list for each element in it. 
#### (c)
This will still work correctly because all this changes is that it will now look for duplicates that are before the current element in the list it has. 
#### (d)
it does not have to check the list twice anymore, only once. 
#### (e)

#### (f)

O(nlog(n)
#### (g)

#### (h)

#### (i)

The only reason I can think of using the slower code would be to take up less memory usage.
